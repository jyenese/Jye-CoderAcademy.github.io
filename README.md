## Purpose

The purpose of my portfolio is to show a potential employer my skills, education, attitude with work, and contact information.

## Functionality / Features

The website has four main navigations in the navbar that should take you to every part of information neccessary. Website is responsive with mobile,tablet or browser. Each page has its own 'next navigation bar' on each page to make it easier to skim through it. A lot of the website has been done with flexbox and sass. Every page has the same footer with my personal linkedin, github, and resume.
